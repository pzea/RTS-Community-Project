Hi there!

This is the project page for a **Real Time Strategy Game** developed by the awesome [Unreal Engine 4 community] (https://forums.unrealengine.com/). 
Started by Satheesh PV (aka ryanjon2040) on Aug-12-2014 this project is meant to be released on PC and possibly for Android and iOS. If you are a Unreal Engine 4 Subscriber then dont wait.
Jump right in and download this project.

This project is aimed to be Blueprint exclusive but this may change in future.

Its simple. You can help in any way you want. By contributing new assets (characters, props, textures, materials etc) or by creating new gameplay mechanics or by creating new levels etc. You can also
help by making this project available in multiple platforms such as Android, iOS, Linux, Mac etc. If you dont want to help, its ok. Just spread the word. :)
